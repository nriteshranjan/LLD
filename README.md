# Snake Ladder LLD

Snake Ladder LLD is a Low-Level Design implementation of the classic board game Snake and Ladder. This project provides a command line interface (CLI) based game where players can roll dice, move their positions on the game board, and encounter snakes and ladders along the way.

## Code Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

- `src/`: Contains the source code files for the Snake Ladder LLD implementation.
  - `Board.java`: Represents the game board with cells, snakes, and ladders.
  - `Player.java`: Defines the player attributes and actions.
  - `Dice.java`: Simulates the rolling of a dice.
  - `Snake.java`: Represents a snake on the game board.
  - `Ladder.java`: Represents a ladder on the game board.
  - `GameController.java`: Manages the overall flow of the game.
